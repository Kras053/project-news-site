# News Site
The news site contains a header with name, logo and navbar and is responsive using flexbox and grid. It has a big news section and a grid of cards with other news with hover effects for desktop mode.

## The problem
There is a bug for the hidden hover effect where a line of text is revealed on hover on desktop mode which glitches but stops by clicking on it. If I had more time I would fix this.
